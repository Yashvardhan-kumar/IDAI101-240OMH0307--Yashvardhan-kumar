 Amazon Data Mining Project

📌 Overview
This project analyzes Amazon's customer data using various **data mining techniques** such as **K-Means clustering, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), User Behavior Analysis, and Association Rule Mining**.

 📊 Key Components

 1️⃣ K-Means Clustering (Customer Segmentation)
- Used for **grouping customers** based on purchasing patterns.
- Features used: `discounted_price`, `actual_price`, `rating`, and `rating_count`.
- Data is **standardized** before applying **K-Means with 3 clusters**.
- Helps in **personalized recommendations and targeted marketing**.

 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Distribution Analysis**: Histogram of `discounted_price` to understand price distribution.
- **Scatter Plots**: Visualizing relationships (e.g., `actual_price` vs `discounted_price`).
- **Correlation Matrix**: Analyzing relationships between numerical variables.
- Useful for **trend detection, anomaly detection, and feature selection**.

 3️⃣ User Behavior Analysis
- Understanding user interactions with products:
  - **Review Content Analysis**: Analyzing review lengths.
  - **Average Rating by Category**: Identifying top-rated categories.
  - **Most Purchased Products**: Based on `rating_count`.
- Helps in **improving user experience and recommendation systems**.

 4️⃣ Association Rule Mining (Market Basket Analysis)
- Finding **frequently bought together** product combinations using:
  - **Apriori Algorithm**.
  - **Association Rules (Support, Confidence, and Lift)**.
- Helps in **cross-selling strategies and product bundling**.

 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, mlxtend)
- **Streamlit** (for interactive UI)
- **Jupyter Notebook/PyCharm** (for development)
